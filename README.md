# UNP_PYTHON_PROJECT_ENGINEERING-STUDENT-SALARY  

This project focuses on analyzing the salaries of engineers using Python. It includes data exploration, visualization, and statistical techniques to uncover trends and factors influencing engineering salaries. The project aims to provide insights into how various factors like experience, education, job location, and industry affect compensation.  
Key Features:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and standardized data for analysis.  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize patterns and distributions.  
3. Statistical Analysis: Conducted correlation studies and hypothesis testing to determine significant factors.  
4. Machine Learning: Built predictive models using algorithms like linear regression to estimate salaries based on input features.  
5. Interactive Insights: Created user-friendly visualizations to interpret results effectivelty.
